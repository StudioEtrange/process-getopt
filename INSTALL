As far as end-users are concerned there is only one file to take care
of and that is process-getopt. This can be placed anywhere on the PATH
perhaps /usr/local/bin.

Developers who intend to create scripts using process-getopt might
also like to install the man page somewhere on MANPATH, perhaps
/usr/local/share/man/man1.
