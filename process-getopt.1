.SH DESCRIPTION
There is a common class of errors in
.BR bash (1)
scripts which arise in the processing of options, even when
.BR getopt (1)
is used; namely, a disagreement between: 
.IP \(bu 2
the constants used to define the option letters or long words (eg '\-c'
or '\-\-cdrom') in the call to
.BR getopt (1)
itself, 
.IP \(bu
the targets of the case statement used to process the returned values
from
.BR getopt (1) 
and 
.IP \(bu
the option letters and words displayed in the help and man pages. 
.P
These inconsistencies are particularly likely to creep in after
maintenance is done on scripts. In any case, this part of the
code is tedious to write and is often skimped.
.P
.BR process-getopt (1)
is intended to eliminate these errors and to automate the creation of
the
.BR getopt (1)
command line, the processing of the options and the printing of the
help and man pages. It also takes a lot of the drudgery and repetition
out of these areas of writing scripts, hopefully increasing the
probability that 
.BR getopt (1)
is used and that documentation is written.
.P
.BR process-getopt (1)
should be sourced by a 
.BR bash (1)
script and the various functions above are then called to process
command\-line options. Some checking is done by
.BR process-getopt (1)
as it starts up.
.P
.BR process-getopt (1)
allows the script to:
.IP \(bu 2
define short and long options in one central place together with descriptions. 
.IP \(bu
provide perfect consistency between the getopt calling parameters, the
case statement processing the user's options and the help/man pages
.IP \(bu
be easy to use and maintain
.IP \(bu
automate help\-page and man\-page printing \- in fact,
.BR process-getopt (1)
provides a default
.BR usage ()
function which suffices for most simple scripts.
.SH FUNCTIONS
Note that if you want to call one of the accessor functions
.RB ( get_opt_letter (),
.BR print_short_args (),
\&... etc) when generating the help page, you can't call them within
the 
.B USAGE 
parameter and so you won't be able to use the default
.BR usage ()
function. 
Instead, you'll need to create a custom
.BR usage ()
function.
.TP
.B process_getopt_version
Prints the version of
.BR process-getopt (1).
This will always be a string of two numbers of the form
.B 1.0
and calling scripts can use this string to ensure they have the right
version or, at least a compatible version. Just like shared libraries,
the final digit will be for bug fixes and the first digit will denote
an API change. Versions will march 1.0 .. 1.9 1.10 1.11 etc.
.TP
.B \fBadd_opt\fR
Defines a new option. It takes the following parameters:
.IP
.B name
is the abstract name that is to be assigned to the option. It must be
given and must be unique.
.IP
.B desc
is the description to be assigned to the option. It should be a fairly
short explanation, although it will be re-formatted if it needs more
than one line on the help screen. It is optional. If not given (eg by
using the "" null string as a position holder) then the option is
\fIsilent\fP and is not printed in the help or man pages.
.IP
.B short_opt
is the single letter option (without a leading '\-') to be assigned to
the option. It is optional, although at least one short or one long
option must be given.
.IP
.B arg_name
For short and long options, if the option takes a value, then define 
.BR arg_name .
This allows
.BR process-getopt (1)
to look for that value as well as print the argument name in the help
and man pages. If
.BR arg_name
is defined for the short option, then it becomes the default for the
long option, and vice versa.
.IP
.B long_opt
is the long option word (without a leading '\-\-') to be assigned to the
option. It is optional, although at least one short or one long option
must be given.
.IP
Note that the order of printing the options in the help and man pages
follows the order of definition by
.BR add_opt .
The standard options are usually printed after the others by calling
.BR print_all_opts .
.IP
Before
.B add_opt
is called, a callback function named
.B ${name}_func
must have been defined.
.BR add_opt
will immediately call the callback function (with no arguments) to
check for its presence. Later on if that option is given on the
command line, the callback function will be called from
.B process_opts
with 2 arguments, namely the option string that triggered the function
and the value associated with the option on the command line, if any.
.TP
.B \fBadd_std_opts\fR
Adds the 'standard options', namely
.IP
.BR help " (\-h, \-\-help),"
.IP
.BR version " (\-V, \-\-version),"
.IP
.BR verbose " {\-v, \-\-verbose),"
.IP
.BR quiet " {\-q, \-\-quiet),"
.IP
.BR end\-options " (\-\-),"
.IP
.BR print\-man\-page " (\-\-print\-man\-page)"
.IP
.B print\-man\-page 
is a 
.I silent
option, not printed in the help or man pages. It is primarily a tool for the developer and when the script is invoked with this option,
.BR process-getopt (1)
prints a skeleton
.BR man (1)
page on stdout and exits. This provides only a starting point for a
typical man page, but at least all the options are formatted, saving a
fair amount of fiddly work. It should probably be called once the
script is more or less finished before using the skeleton to produce a
final manual page.
.TP
\fBcall_getopt\fR [ \fI"$@"\fP ]
Uses the option data created by
.B add_opt
to assemble arguments to be passed to
.BR getopt (1)
and then calls it to re\-order the arguments. See
.BR getopt (1)
for full details.
.TP
\fBprocess_opts\fR [ \fI"$@"\fP ]
Takes each option from the command line and calls the callback
function for that option (previously stored by
.BR add_opt )
with up to two arguments \- the option letter or word itself and any
argument, if appropriate. It is up to the callback function to take
the correct action on receiving the option eg by setting a boolean or
storing the value.
.TP
\fBprint_all_opts\fR [ \fI"$@"\fP ]
Prints all the options in a neatly formatted list.
Normally called from the caller's usage function.
.TP
\fBprint_short_flags\fP
Prints a concatenated list of all the short option letters which do not
take a parameter. These can be considered flags or booleans. They are
listed in the order they were added.
.TP
\fBprint_long_flags\fP
Prints a concatenated list of all the long option strings which do not
take a parameter. These can be considered flags or booleans. They are
listed in the order they were added.
.TP
\fBprint_short_args\fP [ \fIman\fP ]
Prints a concatenated list of all the short options which take a
parameter together with the parameter name. They are listed in the
order they were added. If any argument is given then the list is
formatted for a man page.
.TP
\fBprint_long_args\fP [ \fIman\fP ]
Prints a concatenated list of all the long options which take a
parameter together with the parameter name. They are listed in the
order they were added. If any argument is given then the list is
formatted for a man page.
.TP
\fBprint_all_args\fP [ \fIman\fP ]
Prints a concatenated list of all the options which take a parameter
together with the parameter name. They are listed in the order they
were added. If any argument is given then the list is formatted for a
man page.
.TP
\fBget_opt_letter\fR \fIname\fP
Prints the option letter (if any) assigned to the option \fIname\fP.
Available only after
.BR add_opt .
.TP
\fBget_opt_string\fR \fIname\fP
Prints the long option string (if any) assigned to the option \fIname\fP.
Available only after
.BR add_opt .
.TP
\fBget_opt_sarg\fR \fIname\fP
Prints the argument label assigned to the short option \fIname\fP.
Available only after
.BR add_opt .
.TP
\fBget_opt_larg\fR \fIname\fP
Prints the argument label assigned to the long option \fIname\fP.
Available only after
.BR add_opt .
.TP
\fBget_opt_desc\fR \fIname\fP
Prints the description assigned to the option \fIname\fP.
Available only after
.BR add_opt .
.TP
\fBget_opt_name\fR \fIopt\fP
Prints the name of the option that uses the letter or long string
\fIopt\fP (without the leading \- or \-\-). Available only after
.TP
\fBclean_process_getopt\fR
Cleans up 
.BR process_getopt (1)'s 
address space ready for another bout of
option processing. See \fBcommand_processor\fP for a sample of use.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print this help and exit
.TP
.B \fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version and exit
.TP
.B \fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
do it verbosely
.TP
.B \fB\--\fR
explicitly ends the options
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
All the functions return 0 on success and non\-zero on error except for
.B process_opts
which returns the number of items which should be
.BR 'shift' ed
off the argument list in order to remove the options and their
arguments.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
The following environment parameters are recognised by
.BR process-getopt (1):
.TP
.B PROG
Mandatory. This should be set to the program name, typically
.B $(basename $0)
.TP
.B VERSION
Mandatory. This should be set to the version of the program. It will
be printed in response to the 
.I \-V,\-\-version 
option.
.TP
.B VERBOSE 
Optional. This should be set to the null string before
calling
.B process_opts
and it will be set to non\-null if the 
.I \-v,\-\-verbose
option is given.
.TP 
.B ARGUMENTS
Optional. This should be set to the list of arguments that the script
can take (ie the parameters after the options). It should also be used
in the script's usage() function, if any.
.TP
.B SHORT_DESC
Optional. This should be set to a one line description that will be
inserted into the man page. It should also be used in the
script's `usage' function, if any.
.TP
.B USAGE
Optional. This should be a long string describing the command. It will
be inserted into the help and man pages. It should also be used in the
script's `usage' function, if any. The text will be processed through
.BR fmt (1)
so for best results each paragraph should be coded on a single line. See the
.B EXAMPLES
section.
.TP
.B ARGP_HELP_FMT
Optional. This is the same environment variable recognised by GNU's
.BR argp (3)
C function \- see http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libc/Argp-User-Customization.html The following
comma\-separated clauses are supported here:
.IP 
.B short\-opt\-col=n
This prints the first short option in column n. The default is 2. 
.IP 
.B long\-opt\-col=n
This prints the first long option in column n. The default is 6. 
.IP 
.B opt\-doc\-col=n
This prints the documentation for options starting in column n. The default is 29. 
.IP 
.B rmargin=n
This will word wrap help output at or before column n. The default is 79.
.IP
The default is:
.IP
short\-opt\-col=2,long\-opt\-col=6,opt\-doc\-col=29,rmargin=79
.TP
.B STOP_ON_FIRST_NON_OPT
If this is set, then 
.BR getopt (1) 
will stop processing options
as soon as the first non-option argument is reached without the user
adding a '\-\-'. This is useful in scripts that take another command
as its arguments eg if we wrote a wrapper around
.BR sudo (1) 
we would otherwise have to write:
.IP
\fCmy_sudo -- ls -l /root\fP
.IP
If 
.BR my_sudo (1) 
has 
.IP
\fCexport STOP_ON_FIRST_NON_OPT=yes\fP
.IP
then we can write:
.IP
\fCmy_sudo ls -l /root\fP
.SH "FILES"
.SH "EXAMPLES"
See
.BR example-script (1) 
in this package for a documented sample of use.
See
.BR boilerplate (1) 
in this package for a minimalist boilerplate.
See
.BR testecho (1)
in this package for a simple test program.
See
.BR command-processor (1)
in this package for a slightly more complex program that accepts
commands which can themselves take options (like
.BR openssh (1)
or
.BR cvs (1)).
.SH "NOTES"
If the calling program defines a
.BR usage ()
function then it is called in response to the --help option. If not, a default usage function is provided which relies on the environment parameters and the options added by
.BR add_opt ()
to automatically format a help page.
.P
.BR process-getopt (1)
uses
.BR tput (1)
to determine the width of the terminal for the help page.
.P
.BR process-getopt (1)
is designed to be portable to versions of
.BR getopt (1)
that do not support long options, although this has not been
extensively tested.
.SH "BUGS"
The -V,--verbose and -- options are not very useful when calling
.BR process-getopt (1)
as a script - but then, that's a bit lame anyway.
